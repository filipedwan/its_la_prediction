# Learning analytics course
Predicting CS1 students' final grades.

This repositary contains part of the dataset and code used in the following papers:

* Using learning analytics in the Amazonas: understanding students’ behaviour in introductory programming, published in British journal of educational technology (BJET). 
* Early performance prediction for CS1 course students using a combination of machine learning and an evolutionary algorithm, published in The 19th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT 2019).
* Deep learning for early performance prediction of introductory programming students: a comparative and explanatory study, published in Brazilian journal of computers in education.

We used the data extracted from students’ interactions with [CodeBench](http://codebench.icomp.ufam.edu.br/) during their attempts to solve programming problems in CS1 courses oferred at Federal University of Amazonas. The data was collected in the very first two weeks of the CS1 courses, allowing thus for early performance prediction. Notice that the CSVs have only part of the features used in the aforementioned papers. If you want the complete CSVs, please send an email justifying the request.

If you use our dataset or code for a scientific publication, we would appreciate citations to the aforementioned papers. Find below the papers in the APA format:
